#Notes
Css is mobile first approach
There is no filter in the tablet and mobile design so made it hidden for these specific sizes.
Assumption - Hotels are clickable and should go to hotel detail page
Assumtion - Green Button has been added in the mobile to let the user know that hotels are clickable.
Not created a nav bar as it was not there in the design, but clicking on hotels will take the user to hotel Details page and clicking on logo will take him to Home page
